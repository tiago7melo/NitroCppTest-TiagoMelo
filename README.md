# NitroCppTest-TiagoMelo
CLI app that will intersect axis aligned rectangles given a JSON file that describes a canvas of potentially intersecting rectangles.

Implemented as part of C++ proficiency assessment for Nitro.

# Dependencies

# Building
-> Debug with Tests
-> Release with No Tests

# Usage

The format of your JSON file should be: 
-> Contains ["rects"]
-> Each rects has x,y,z,w




Running the tests:


# TODO: Please include sources for any such libraries in your repo or include steps to get them automatically as part of your build script, project, solution, etc. Donâ€™t overdo the use of third party libraries. 


# TODO: Ensure the root folder has a README file detailing any steps needed to build the code. How easy it is to build the program is relevant.

# TODO: specify that the build commands need to be ran from the root dir of the project

# TODO: specify how to give the option to exceed the default limit of 10 rectangles
